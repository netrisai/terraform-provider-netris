# Netris Provider


The Netris provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Netris](https://www.netris.ai/).
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netris = {
      source  = "netrisai/netris"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

# Configure the Netris Provider.
provider "netris" {
  address = var.controller_address
  login = var.controller_login
  password = var.controller_password
}

# Create a VNet: Adding physical switch ports to a virtual overlay network
resource "netris_vnet" "my-vnet" {
  name = "my-vnet"
  owner = "Admin"
  sites{
    name = "Santa Clara"
    gateways {
      prefix = "203.0.113.1/24"
    }
    ports {
      name = "swp1@my-softgate"
    }
  }
}

```
