# Netris Provider


The Netris provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Netris](https://www.netris.ai/).
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netris = {
      source  = "netrisai/netris"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

# Configure the Netris Provider.
provider "netris" {
  address = var.controller_address
  login = var.controller_login
  password = var.controller_password
}

# Create a VNet: Adding physical switch ports to a virtual overlay network
resource "netris_vnet" "my-vnet" {                                ## [todo] add site
  name = "my-vnet"
  owner = "Admin"
  state = "active"
  gateways {
        prefix = "109.23.0.6/24"
  }
  ports {
        name = "swp9@Yerevan-Spine1"
        vlanid = 1050
  }
}

```
