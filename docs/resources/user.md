# netris_user

~> **Note:** User require `userrole`/`pgroup` to exist prior to resource creation. Use `depends_on` to set an explicit dependency on the `userrole`/`pgroup`/.

## Example Usages

```hcl
data "netris_tenant" "my-tenant" {
  name = "my-tenant"
}

resource "netris_user" "terrraform-user" {
  username = "terraform"
  fullname = "Terraform"
  email = "terraform@netris.ai"
  emailcc = "devops@netris.ai"
  phone = "6504570097"
  company = "Netris, Inc."
  position = "DevOps Engineer"
  userrole = ""
  pgroup = "my-group"
  tenants {
    id = -1
    edit = false
  }
  tenants {
    id = data.netris_tenant.my-tenant.id
    edit = true
  }
  depends_on = [
    netris_permission_group.my-group,
  ]
}
```
