# netris_tenant

IP addresses and Switch Ports are network resources that can be assigned to different Tenants to have under their management. Admin is the default tenant, and by default, it owns all the resources. The concept of Tenants can be used for sharing and delegation of control over the network resources, typically used by network teams to grant access to other teams for requesting & managing network services using the Netris Controller as a self service portal or programmatically (with Kubernetes CRDs) as part of DevOps/NetOps pipeline.

A Tenant has just two fields, the unique name and custom description.

## Example Usages

```hcl
resource "netris_tenant" "my-tenant" {
      name = "my-tenant"
      description = "Terraform Test Tenant"
}
