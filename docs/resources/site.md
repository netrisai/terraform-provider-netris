# netris_site

Each separate deployment (each data center) should be defined as a Site. All network units and resources are attached to a site. Netris Controller comes with a “default” site preconfigured. Site entry defines global attributes such as; AS numbers, default ACL policy, and Site Mesh (site to site VPN) type.
## Example Usages

```hcl
resource "netris_site" "santa-clara" {
  name = "Santa Clara"
  publicasn = 65001
  rohasn = 65502
  vmasn = 65503
  rohroutingprofile = "default"
  sitemesh = "hub"
  acldefaultpolicy = "permit"
}

```

## Schema

### Required

- **acldefaultpolicy** (String) Possible values: `permit` or `deny`. Deny - Layer-3 packet forwarding is denied by default. ACLs are required to permit necessary traffic flows.

- **name** (String) The name of the site
- **publicasn** (Number) Site public ASN that should be used for external bgp peer configuration
- **rohasn** (Number) ASN for ROH (Routing on the Host) compute instances, should be unique within the scope of a site, can be same for different sites
- **rohroutingprofile** (String) ROH Routing profile defines set of routing prefixes to be advertised to ROH instances. Possible values: `default`, `default_agg`, `full`. Default route only - Will advertise 0.0.0.0/0 + loopback address of physically connected switch. Default + Aggregate - Will add prefixes of defined subnets + `Default` profile. Full - Will advertise all prefixes available in the routing table of the connected switch
- **sitemesh** (String) Site to site VPN mode. Site mesh available values are: `disabled`, `hub`, `spoke`, `dspoke`
- **vmasn** (Number) ASN for ROH (Routing on the Host) virtual compute instances, should be unique within the scope of a site, can be same for different sites
