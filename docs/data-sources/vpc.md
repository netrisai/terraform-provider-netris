# Data Source: netris_vpc

Netris enables the creation and management of multiple isolated Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) within a single hardware infrastructure. Each Netris VPC runs an isolated virtual routing and forwarding table (VRF) with BGP, static routing, and looking glass (centralized routing table lookup) support. Netris VPCs also provide isolated IPAM and V-Net (Layer2 with default gateway).
